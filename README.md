# Multi-Agent Network Systems
## Goals for this Repository 
This Repository is meant to be for educational purposes and to assist with learning Multi-Agent Network Systems.

To create code implementations and explanations of Multi-Agent Network Systems based off of class notes. 

Explain the mathmatics and ideas in a meaningful way and give links to resources to help with learning. 

## How will the code and explanations be available?
I will make each topic I discuss into a notebook format so it will be easy to access and view. 

I will also create folders as needed for different topics.

## Issues?
Please let me know if there are any issues within the code.
